#The W446 rule flags output ports that are read in the module where they are set.
#Such models could lead to an unintended feedback path from the instantiating module in the post-synthesis simulation while this issue is not apparent 
#in the pre-synthesis simulation. Such models are also not recommended for some test tools that need to handle inout ports specially (by attaching 
#bus-holders, for example).

#The W280 rule flags intra-assignment delays specified with nonblocking assignments.
#Such description is unlikely to correspond to the physical implementation. However, such description may be required to use a unit delay to avoid 
#race conditions in simulation.

#The STARC05-2.3.6.1 rule does not report violation for hanging flip-flops.
